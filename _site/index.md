<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the listening test</h1>

This listening assessment is comprised of 2 parts:

* Test 1: **Sound quality**
* Test 2: **Interference by other instruments**

The order in which you take each test is set by the experimenter.
Each test will take between 30 and 50 minutes.

In both cases you will listen to 8 samples of an extraction of vocals and their
backings from a song. You then rate according to the given perceptual attribute.
This task is then repeated for a number of songs.
Both experiments involve an initial training stage which will:

- Allow you to familiarise yourself with the perceptual attribute we are
  interested in.
- Give you an opportunity to gain some intuition for the main interface.

Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions or wish to take a
break at any point!
