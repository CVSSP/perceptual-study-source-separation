<h2 style="text-align: center;">Please rate the sound quality compared to the reference</h2>

This is a training page for you to familiarise yourself with the user interface
and also listen to examples of the type of stimuli involved. For this test, you
should compare the **sound quality** of the test stimuli with the reference
stimulus.

- You can play the reference stimulus or stop playback by using the two buttons above the sliders.
- Switch between the test stimuli by clicking on the corresponding slider buttons. 
- You can then rate each stimulus by sliding the button.
