<h1 style="text-align: center;">Training: Interference</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Please rate the amount of interference by other instruments</h2>

This is a training page for you to familiarise yourself with the user interface
and also listen to examples of the type of sounds involved. For this test, you
should rate the amount of **interference** present in the test sounds compared
with the reference sound. Remember, it does **not** include artefacts or
distortions.

- Click the 'Reference' button to play the reference sound.
- Click the 'Stop' button to stop playback. This will also reset the start position.
- Switch between the test sounds by clicking on the corresponding slider buttons. 
- You can then rate each sounds by sliding the button.
- Click the 'Sort' button to sort the sliders by rating.
