<h2 style="text-align: center;">Please rate the amount of interference by other instruments</h2>

This is a training page to get used to the involved stimuli and the user
interface.

You can switch between the test stimuli by clicking on the corresponding slider
buttons. With the slider button you can then also give your rating of that
particular test stimulus. You can switch to the reference or stop the playback
by the buttons above the sliders.
