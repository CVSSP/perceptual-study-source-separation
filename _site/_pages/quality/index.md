<h1 style="text-align: center;">Sound quality</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Please rate the sound quality compared to the reference</h2>

**Sound quality** relates to the amount of artefacts or distortions affecting
the perception of a reference sound. <br/>
These can be heard as tone-like additions, abrupt changes in loudness, or
missing parts of the audio. <br/>
It does **not** include changes in the amount of interference by other
instruments that might be heard beside the vocals.
