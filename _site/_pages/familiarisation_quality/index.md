## Definitions

**Sound quality** relates to the amount of artefacts or distortions affecting
the perception of a reference sound. <br/>
These can be heard as tone-like additions, abrupt changes in loudness, or
missing parts of the audio. <br/>
It does **not** include changes in the amount of interference by other
instruments that might be heard beside the vocals.

**Interference** describes the amount of other instruments that are audible
beside the vocals. <br/>
It does **not** include artefacts or distortions that belong to the vocals.
