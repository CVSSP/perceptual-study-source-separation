abstract: |
    There is some uncertainty as to whether objective metrics for predicting the
    perceived quality of audio source separation are sufficiently accurate.
    This issue was investigated by employing a revised experimental methodology
    to collect subjective ratings of sound quality and interference of
    singing-voice recordings that have been extracted from musical mixtures
    using state-of-the-art audio source separation. A correlation analysis
    between the experimental data and the measures of two objective evaluation
    toolkits, BSS Eval and PEASS, was performed to assess their performance. The
    artifacts-related perceptual score of the PEASS toolkit had the strongest
    correlation with the perception of artifacts and distortions caused by
    singing-voice separation. Both the source-to-interference ratio of BSS Eval
    and the interference-related perceptual score of PEASS showed comparable
    correlations with the human ratings of interference.
