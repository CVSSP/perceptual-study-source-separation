\begin{abstract}
The abstract should appear at the top of the left-hand column of text, about
0.5 inch (12 mm) below the title area and no more than 3.125 inches (80 mm) in
length.  Leave a 0.5 inch (12 mm) space between the end of the abstract and the
beginning of the main text.  The abstract should contain about 100 to 150
words, and should be identical to the abstract text submitted electronically
along with the paper cover sheet.  All manuscripts must be in English, printed
in black ink.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

These guidelines include complete descriptions of the fonts, spacing, and
related information for producing your proceedings manuscripts. Please follow
them and if you have any questions, direct them to Conference Management
Services, Inc.: Phone +1-979-846-6800 or email
to \\\texttt{papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org}.

\section{Formatting your paper}
\label{sec:format}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area of 7 inches (178 mm) wide by 9 inches (229 mm) high. Do
not write or print anything outside the print area. The top margin must be 1
inch (25 mm), except for the title page, and the left margin must be 0.75 inch
(19 mm).  All {\it text} must be in a two-column format. Columns are to be 3.39
inches (86 mm) wide, with a 0.24 inch (6 mm) space between them. Text must be
fully justified.

\section{PAGE TITLE SECTION}
\label{sec:pagestyle}

The paper title (on the first page) should begin 1.38 inches (35 mm) from the
top edge of the page, centered, completely capitalized, and in Times 14-point,
boldface type.  The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title
in capital and lower case letters.  Papers with multiple authors and
affiliations may require two or more lines for this information. Please note
that papers should not be submitted blind; include the authors' names on the
PDF.

\section{TYPE-STYLE AND FONTS}
\label{sec:typestyle}

To achieve the best rendering both in printed proceedings and electronic proceedings, we
strongly encourage you to use Times-Roman font.  In addition, this will give
the proceedings a more uniform look.  Use a font that is no smaller than nine
point type throughout the paper, including figure captions.

In nine point type font, capital letters are 2 mm high.  {\bf If you use the
smallest point size, there should be no more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch)
vertically.}  This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make
the paper much more readable.  Larger type sizes require correspondingly larger
vertical spacing.  Please do not double-space your paper.  TrueType or
Postscript Type 1 fonts are preferred.

The first paragraph in each section should not be indented, but all the
following paragraphs within the section should be indented as these paragraphs
demonstrate.

\section{MAJOR HEADINGS}
\label{sec:majhead}

Major headings, for example, "1. Introduction", should appear in all capital
letters, bold face if possible, centered in the column, with one blank line
before, and one blank line after. Use a period (".") after the heading number,
not a colon.

\subsection{Subheadings}
\label{ssec:subhead}

Subheadings should appear in lower case (initial word capitalized) in
boldface.  They should start at the left margin on a separate line.
 
\subsubsection{Sub-subheadings}
\label{sssec:subsubhead}

Sub-subheadings, as in this paragraph, are discouraged. However, if you
must use them, they should appear in lower case (initial word
capitalized) and start at the left margin on a separate line, with paragraph
text beginning on the following line.  They should be in italics.

\section{PRINTING YOUR PAPER}
\label{sec:print}

Print your properly formatted text on high-quality, 8.5 x 11-inch white printer
paper. A4 paper is also acceptable, but please leave the extra 0.5 inch (12 mm)
empty at the BOTTOM of the page and follow the top and left margins as
specified.  If the last page of your paper is only partially filled, arrange
the columns so that they are evenly balanced if possible, rather than having
one long column.

In LaTeX, to start a new column (but not a new page) and help balance the
last-page column lengths, you can use the command ``$\backslash$pagebreak'' as
demonstrated on this page (see the LaTeX source below).

\section{PAGE NUMBERING}
\label{sec:page}

Please do {\bf not} paginate your paper.  Page numbers, session numbers, and
conference identification will be inserted when the paper is included in the
proceedings.

\section{ILLUSTRATIONS, GRAPHS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS}
\label{sec:illust}

Illustrations must appear within the designated margins.  They may span the two
columns.  If possible, position illustrations at the top of columns, rather
than in the middle or at the bottom.  Caption and number every illustration.
All halftone illustrations must be clear black and white prints.  Colors may be
used, but they should be selected so as to be readable when printed on a
black-only printer.

Since there are many ways, often incompatible, of including images (e.g., with
experimental results) in a LaTeX document, below is an example of how to do
this \cite{Lamp86}.

\section{FOOTNOTES}
\label{sec:foot}

Use footnotes sparingly (or not at all!) and place them at the bottom of the
column on the page on which they are referenced. Use Times 9-point type,
single-spaced. To help your readers, avoid using footnotes altogether and
include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if
you prefer, as in this sentence).

% Below is an example of how to insert images. Delete the ``\vspace'' line,
% uncomment the preceding line ``\centerline...'' and replace ``imageX.ps''
% with a suitable PostScript file name.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------


% To start a new column (but not a new page) and help balance the last-page
% column length use \vfill\pagebreak.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{COPYRIGHT FORMS}
\label{sec:copyright}

You must submit your fully completed, signed IEEE electronic copyright release
form when you submit your paper. We {\bf must} have this form before your paper
can be published in the proceedings.

\section{RELATION TO PRIOR WORK}
\label{sec:prior}

The text of the paper should contain discussions on how the paper's
contributions are related to prior work in the field. It is important
to put new work in  context, to give credit to foundational work, and
to provide details associated with the previous work that have appeared
in the literature. This discussion may be a separate, numbered section
or it may appear elsewhere in the body of the manuscript, but it must
be present.

You should differentiate what is new and how your work expands on
or takes a different path from the prior studies. An example might
read something to the effect: "The work presented here has focused
on the formulation of the ABC algorithm, which takes advantage of
non-uniform time-frequency domain analysis of data. The work by
Smith and Cohen \cite{Lamp86} considers only fixed time-domain analysis and
the work by Jones et al \cite{C2} takes a different approach based on
fixed frequency partitioning. While the present study is related
to recent approaches in time-frequency analysis [3-5], it capitalizes
on a new feature space, which was not considered in these earlier
studies."

\section{REFERENCES}
\label{sec:refs}

List and number all bibliographical references at the end of the
paper. The references can be numbered in alphabetic order or in
order of appearance in the document. When referring to them in
the text, type the corresponding reference number in square
brackets as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{C2}. An
additional final page (the fifth page, in most cases) is
allowed, but must contain only references to the prior
literature.

% References should be produced using the bibtex program from suitable
% BiBTeX files (here: strings, refs, manuals). The IEEEbib.bst bibliography
% style file from IEEE produces unsorted bibliography list.
