# Welcome to the listening test

This listening assessment is comprised of 2 parts:

* Test 1: **Sound quality**
* Test 2: **Interference**

The order in which you take each test is set by the experimenter.
Each test will take between 30 and 50 minutes.

In both cases you will listen to 8 samples of a vocal recording that has been
extracted from a song. Your task is to compare each sample with a reference
sound and then rate it according to one of the two perceptual attributes:
quality or interference. This task is then repeated for a number of songs.  Both
experiments involve an initial training stage which will allow you to:

- Familiarise yourself with the perceptual attribute we are interested in.
- Gain some intuition for the main interface.

Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions or wish to take a
break at any point!
