# Interference

## Please rate the interference

**Interference** describes the loudness of the instruments compared to the
loudness of the vocals. For example, 'strong interference' indicates a strong
contribution from other instruments, whereas 'no interference' means that you
can only hear the vocals. 

Interference does **not** include artefacts or distortions that you may
perceive.
