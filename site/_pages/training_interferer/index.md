# Training: Interference

## Please rate the interference

This is a training page for you to familiarise yourself with the user interface
and also listen to examples of the type of sounds involved. For this test, you
should rate the **interference** of the test sounds compared with the reference
sound.

**Interference** describes the loudness of the instruments compared to the
loudness of the vocals. For example, 'strong interference' indicates a strong
contribution from other instruments, whereas 'no interference' means that you
can only hear the vocals. 

Interference does **not** include artefacts or distortions that you may
perceive.

- Click the **Reference** button to play the reference sound.
- Click the **Stop** button to stop playback. This will also reset the start position.
- Use the slider buttons to listen to the different test sounds. 
- You can then rate each sound by dragging the button or clicking on the slider track.
- Click the **Sort** button to sort the sliders by rating.
