# Familiarisation

## Definitions

### Sound quality
**Sound quality** relates to the amount of artefacts or distortions affecting
the perception of a reference sound.

These can be heard as tone-like additions, abrupt changes in loudness, or
missing parts of the audio.

It does **not** include changes in the amount of interference by other
instruments that might be heard besides the vocals.

### Interference
**Interference** describes the amount of other instruments that are audible
besides the vocals.

It does **not** include artefacts or distortions.

## Examples

1. The first row of sounds demonstrates different amounts of interference as the
   background instruments are added to the vocals. In all cases, the sound
   quality is the same as the reference.

2. The second row of sounds demonstrates changes in sound quality as artefacts
   and distortions are added to the vocals. In all cases, there is no interference.
