# Example Test: Interference

## Please rate the interference

Rate the **interference** of the test sounds compared with the reference

**Interference** describes the loudness of the instruments compared to the
loudness of the vocals. For example, 'strong interference' indicates a strong
contribution from other instruments, whereas 'no interference' means that you
can only hear the vocals. 

Interference does **not** include artefacts or distortions that you may
perceive.

- Click the **Reference** button to play the reference sound.
- Click the **Stop** button to stop playback. This will also reset the audio to the start.
- Use the slider buttons to listen to the different test sounds. 
- You can then rate the interference of each sound by dragging the slider button along the track.
- Click the **Sort** button to sort the sliders by rating.
