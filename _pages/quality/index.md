# Sound quality

## Please rate the sound quality compared to the reference

**Sound quality** relates to the amount of artefacts or distortions affecting
the perception of a reference sound.

These can be heard as tone-like additions, abrupt changes in loudness, or
missing parts of the audio.

It does **not** include changes in the amount of interference by other
instruments that might be heard beside the vocals.
