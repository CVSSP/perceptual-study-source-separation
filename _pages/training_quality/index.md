# Training: Sound quality

## Please rate the sound quality compared to the reference

This is a training page for you to familiarise yourself with the user interface
and also listen to examples of the type of sounds involved. For this test, you
should rate the **sound quality** of the test sounds by comparing them with the reference
sound.

- Click the **Reference** button to play the reference sound.
- Click the **Stop** button to stop playback. This will also reset the start position.
- Use the slider buttons to listen to the different test sounds. 
- You can then rate each sound by dragging the button or clicking on the slider track.
- Click the **Sort** button to sort the sliders by rating.
